                        <p>I created <span class="logoder">Der</span><span class="logodie">Die</span><span class="logodas">Das</span> in 2019. I had just fished 
                            HarvardX's CS50: Introduction to Computer Science class on edX. I was also studying German at a lannguage school in WÃ¼rzburg, a 
                            city in southern Germany. Learning German presents the same problem as leaning any new language, in that there is a lot of unfamiliar
                            grammar to memorize. In addition, German has three noun genders and four cases which effect the sentance structure in a way unfamiliar
                            to native English speakers. These cases and genders are "attached" to different nouns and prepoisitions in a way that can only be learned 
                            by rote memorization. I wanted to put my new programming skills to use and develop an app which would help me memorize these gramatic 
                            concepts.

                        <p>To create this application I used Python and Postgresql on the back end and JavaScript, CSS and HTML on the front end. The code for this project
                            is admittedly messy. It is my first "large" project that I've built from the ground up. I didn't use a front end JavaScript framework or CSS 
                            preprocessors. On the backend I used Python's Flask library for HTML templating and SQLAlchemy for database management. I built ORM models, but 
                            queried with plain SQL to better learn the syntax. The source code for this project can be found 
                            <a href="https://github.com/derek-watson14/DerDieDas">here</a>, on my GitHub account.

                        <p>I learned a ton while creating this project, before starting I had very limited JavaScript knowledge. Now I am comfortable with things like arrow
                            functions, forEach, map, filter, find and reduce. I've also learned a lot about JSON, AJAX (without jQuery) Local Storage on the browser and of course
                            manipulating the DOM. I had never used a database outside of SQLite before this project. I had to download Postgresql on my machine and
                            learn how to connect to it with Python. I also learned how to build ORM models to create my tables. Besides that in Python I practiced list 
                            comprehensions, ternary expressions and other useful features of the language. I knew only the absolute basics of CSS and HTML before hand. 
                            Now I have a working understanding of when to use different HTML tags and in CSS I have learned about media queries, flexbox and many other
                            small and large CSS tricks.
