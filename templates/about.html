                                I had just finished HarvardX's <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science" target="_blank">CS50: Introduction to Computer Science</a>
                                class on edX. I was also studying German at a lannguage school in WÃ¼rzburg, a city in southern Germany. Learning German presents the same problem
                                as leaning any new language, in that there is a lot of unfamiliar grammar to memorize. In addition, German has three noun genders and
                                four cases which effect the sentance structure in a way unfamiliar to native English speakers. These cases and genders are "attached"
                                to different nouns and prepoisitions in a way that can only be learned by rote memorization. I wanted to put my new programming skills
                                to use and develop an app which would help me memorize these gramatic 
                                concepts.</p>

                            <p>The backend of this application uses <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Flask</strong> and <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> for a database. 
                                Flask is a Python microframework for the web that uses Jinja 2 as a templating language. Using Flask with Python allows me to serve 
                                web pages which can change based on factors like a user being logged in or a game being in progress. PostgreSQL is where I store the 
                                questions for each game type, user information and user scores and grades. The database is managed with a Python library called
                                SQLAlchemy, which I also used for ORM. The tables were created with SQLAlchemy models, but queries are done in pure SQL because I
                                wanted to learn SQL syntax and not just SQLAlchemy.</p>

                            <p>The frontend was built with <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>CSS3</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. I choose not to use a front end 
                                framework or CSS preprocessors because I wanted to focus on learning the basics for this project. I was able to do all the DOM manipulation
                                that I needed with pure JavaScript. Even AJAX requests were done with the <em>XMLHttpRequest()</em> object. In the future I would like to 
                                try using some of the newer frontend technologies like Javascript frameworks and CSS preprocessors. More about that in the learning section.</p>

                            <p>For my first project, I'm aware my code doesn't follow best practices. In fact, experienced developers woud probably consider it to be disorganized.
                                Originally I had planned to go through and refactor everything to make it more presentable, but in the end I've decided to move on to new projects
                                and learn from my mistakes with a green field. <strong>Git</strong> was used throughout the project to track versions; the current code is viewable

                            <p>During this project I significantly increased my understanding of CSS and HTML through trail and error, StackOverflow and parts of
                                the useful HTML and CSS tutorial over at <a href="https://internetingishard.com/" target="_blank">Interneting Is Hard</a>. I now feel pretty comfortable
                                using Flexbox, and I know a few CSS tricks like <em>transition</em>, <em>media queries</em> and relative sizing with <em>em</em> and 
                                <em>rem</em>, among other things. </p>
                            <p>In the future I woud like to use a CSS naming convention like <em>BEM</em> to stay more organized and a CSS preprocessor
                                like SASS. I am also interested in trying to build a site using a <em>functional CSS framework</em>, namely TailwindCSS. I am intruiged
                                by the idea of using utility classes and components to make CSS more reusable and scalable.</p>

                            <summary class="sc-subsection__summary">JavaScript</summary>
                            <p>During the project I went from almost no JavaScript to being comforable manipulating the DOM using Element class methods
                                like <em>Element.querySelector()</em>, using anonymous functions and arrow syntax, using higher order functions like <em>map()</em> and 
                                <em>filter()</em> on iterators and other tricks like <em>forEach</em>. I also learned about <em>JSON</em>, <em>Local Storage</em> and 
                                AJAX using <em>XMLHttpRequest()</em>.</p>
                            <p>In the futrure I would like to try working with a Javascript framework like React, Vue or Angular, though I've not yet chosen
                                which one of those to look into first. I hope it can speed my development process and add more structure to my applications as a whole. That being 
                                said, I want to be careful that I continue learing JavaScript, and not just frameworks.</p>

                            <p>During the project I learned quite a bit about using Flask and Jinja 2 to serve websites. I love the ability to template HTML pages
                                with these tools. Having easy access to extras like password encryption and Sessions is a bonus. My understanding of some more complex SQL like JOIN
                                also improved, which was necessary to access the database I built using ORM models provided by SQLAlchemy. 
                                Finally, I learned more basic Python syntax like list comprehensions, class declarations and function decorators.</p>
                            <p>In the future I would like to build another app with Flask and possibly look into what Python's <em>Django</em> framework can offer. Outside of 
                                Python backends, I would like to build a backend with <em>Node</em> and <em>Express</em> in a future project. I would also like to learn more complex SQL
                                syntax and dip my feet into NoSQL databases like <em>MongoDB</em>. Site security is also a theme I would like to explore further.</p>
