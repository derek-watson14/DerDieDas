# DerDieDas
My final project for HarvardX's CS50 course. Will be a web application that tests a user's knowledge of the gender of common German nouns, and other German grammar concepts. Uses Python with Flask, SQL, Vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.  

More details about my build on the about page of the site, but this was built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript on the frontend and Python, Flask and PostgresSQL on the backend.

I worked extremely hard on this project when I was making it, and learned a ton about creating user loging, managing user data, creating dynamic content for different users, as well as more basic concepts like DOM manipulation and different CSS properties.
